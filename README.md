## Abstract

Recent research finds that learners able to self- regulate their learning show greater engagement with the MOOC content. As an approach to better support learners’ in their self- regulatory processes, technological solutions have been proposed to transform recorded MOOC data into meaningful and actionable knowledge. However, studies providing empirical evidence on how these solutions impact learners’ engagement with the course and their self-regulatory behavior are still scarce. In this study, we present the results of an observational case study in which NoteMyProgress (NMP), a web-based tool designed to support learners’ self-regulation in MOOCs, is applied as an intervention into two MOOCs of Coursera. The main aim of this study is to provide insights about how supporting learners’ SRL strategies has an effect on engagement with the MOOC resources. The evaluation was conducted with a sample of 263 learners. Different data sources, from log files to SRL self-reported questionnaires capturing learners’ profile, are used to propose indicators of learners’ engagement with the course and NMP. The results suggest that supporting learners’ SRL profile had an effect on their engagement with the course content. Specifically, learners who used NMP: (1) were more committed to assessments and lectures; (2) completed more lectures and initiated more supplemental activities; and (3) obtained higher grades. Also, we found no significant behavioral differences in how learners with low SRL and high SRL profiles engage with the course or NMP. We discuss how these results relate to prior work and implications for future technological solutions for promoting engagement in MOOCs.
